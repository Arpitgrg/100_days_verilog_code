# 100_days_verilog_code

Description:
This repository contains the Verilog code for a 100-day challenge to improve RTL design skills. The challenge consists of designing and implementing a different RTL circuit each day for 100 days.

Features:
100 RTL designs: The repository contains 100 different RTL designs, covering a wide range of topics, from basic combinational circuits to more complex sequential circuits.
Verilog code: All of the RTL designs are implemented in Verilog code, which is a popular HDL (Hardware Description Language) for FPGA and ASIC design.
Detailed explanations: Each RTL design is accompanied by a detailed explanation of its functionality and implementation.

Benefits:
Improve your RTL design skills     
Gain hands-on experience in designing digital circuits using Verilog       
Learn about a variety of RTL design topics      
Build a portfolio of Verilog code examples       
Connect with other RTL designers and share your knowledge
